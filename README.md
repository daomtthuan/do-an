<h2>2. PROBLEM DEFINITION OF MILK TEA SHOP</h2>
Milk Tea Shop is a milk tea shop specializing in selling milk tea and fast food. The main
customers that it serves are students. When customers come to the shop, they order food
and choose their own seat that they like then pay for bill at cashier.<br>
But recently, the number of customers is increasing. The shop manager feels difficult to
record and manage not only the invoice but also revenue of the shop. In addition,
employees cannot write lots of order bill every day. So, they want to have a system can
help them to manage their shop that customers can order bill simpler and employees
don’t work too much.<br>
The system will provide functions:<br>
• Customers can order food, choose their table that they like then pay at cashier.<br>
• Customers can register and log in to system or enter discount code to receive
the discount for bill.<br>
• Employees and manager must log in to use system.<br>
• Employees can manage order bills in food tables, status of food tables, and
food.<br>
• Manager can manage bills, employees, accounts and income of shop.<br>
• Manager’s actions include view, insert, update, delete. But employee cannot
delete or update anything. The order bill can be canceled in the order process
but not delete when customer has paid.<br>
Beside that:<br>
• The system must run smoothly, without errors from the system side.<br>
• Fast execution speed, serving the crowded customer flow.<br><br>
